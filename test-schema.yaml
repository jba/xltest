title: Test
description: |
    A Test describes one or more test cases.
    Each test case describes the expected result of calling a function on an input.
    The function itself, and how the result is validated, are not part of a Test;
    they are both described in natural language, either in the test description or in
    a comment in the test file.
type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: A short name for the test, used in test runner output.
    type: string

  description:
    description: A longer description of the test.
    type: string

  env:
    description: |
      A mapping from environment variable names to the values they should have during the test.
      Once the test is finished, the environment variables are restored to their previous values.
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string

  in:
    description: |
      The input to the function under test.
      If omitted, the test is solely a container for subtests.
    # Any type is permitted.

  want:
    description: |
      The expected output of the test function on the input.
      It is an error to omit 'in' but provide 'want'.
      It is not an error to provide 'in' but omit 'want', because
      the validation function may check whether the the function result
      has some property, rather than comparing it with a desired value.
    # Any type is permitted.
    
  subtests:
    description: |
      Zero or more tests that are run, sequentially and in the order given,
      after the parent test (if any) is run.
    type: array
    items:
      '$ref': '#'
