# Setting environment variables in tests.
# The "env" field contains a dictionary of variable names and values.
# Before the test, the environment variables are set to the given values,
# and after the test they are restored.
#
# The function under test should take a string and behave as follows:
# If the string is non-empty, return it.
# Otherwise, if the XLTEST environment variable is set, return its value.
# Otherwise, return the empty string.
